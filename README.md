## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes salary trends in the Indian software industry to identify key factors influencing compensation and build predictive models for salary estimation.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- Identify primary drivers of salary variation (role, location, experience)
- Validate salary differences through statistical hypothesis testing
- Build machine learning models to predict salaries
- Create interactive dashboard for stakeholder insights

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 💡 Main Insights

1. **Geographic Impact**: Tier-1 cities have **32.35% high-paying roles** vs **27.91% in Tier-2** cities (statistically significant, p < 0.05)

2. **Job Role Dominance**: Job Title accounts for **~60% of salary prediction power**, making it the strongest factor

3. **Predictive Performance**: Random Forest model achieved **R² = 0.78** (78% variance explained)

4. **Salary Distribution**: Highly right-skewed with median ₹5.00L and mean ₹6.95L

5. **Rating Impact**: Weak correlation (r = 0.15-0.25) between company rating and salary

## 🔬 Statistical Analysis

### Hypothesis Tests Conducted:

1. **T-Test**: Tier-1 vs Tier-2 salaries → ✅ Significant difference (p < 0.05)
2. **ANOVA**: Job role impact on salary → ✅ Highly significant (p < 0.001)
3. **Chi-Square**: Salary band distribution by city tier → ✅ Significant (p < 0.05)
4. **Correlation**: Company rating vs salary → Weak positive (r = 0.20)

## 💼 Business Implications

**For Job Seekers:**
- Prioritize role selection over location when maximizing salary
- Senior roles in Tier-2 cities often pay more than junior roles in Tier-1 cities

**For Career Planning:**
- Tier-1 cities provide better upside for career growth and high-salary opportunities
- Role progression has 3x more impact than location change

**For Employers:**
- Competitive salaries in Tier-1 cities are essential for talent attraction
- Role-based compensation is more critical than location-based adjustments
